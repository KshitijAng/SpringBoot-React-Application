```
spring:
  application:
    name: demo
  ai:
    openai:
      api-key: "API_KEY_HERE" 
      base-url: "https://api.groq.com/openai"
```

### Note: SpringBoot applications runs at `Port 8080` by default

## Why GPT-OSS-20B with Groq?

This project uses **Groq's GPT-OSS-20B**, a powerful **20-billion parameter open-source language model**, to enable advanced AI capabilities such as chat, code generation, and intelligent text processing.  

### ðŸš€ Why Groq?
- **Lightning-Fast Responses** â€“ Groq's hardware-accelerated LPUâ„¢ (Language Processing Unit) architecture delivers **millisecond-level inference**, making interactions feel instant compared to traditional GPU-backed APIs.
- **Native Support for Open-Source Models** â€“ Groq provides seamless hosting for top-tier open models, including LLaMA, Mistral, Gemma, and OSS GPT variants, without the vendor lock-in of closed models.
- **Scalability & Reliability** â€“ Built for production-grade AI workloads with low-latency APIs and high uptime.

### ðŸ’¡ Why GPT-OSS-20B?
- **Open-Source Freedom** â€“ Fully transparent weights and architecture allow customization and fine-tuning for specific domains.
- **Massive Knowledge Capacity** â€“ With 20 billion parameters, it rivals proprietary models in reasoning, coding, and creative tasks.
- **Cost-Effective** â€“ No per-token costs tied to closed ecosystemsâ€”Groqâ€™s efficient hosting makes high-performance AI more affordable.

In short, **Groq + GPT-OSS-20B** means **blazing speed, open-source flexibility, and production-ready reliability**â€”perfect for both experimentation and enterprise-grade AI applications.

## ðŸŸ  Testing Spring Boot Application with Postman

Postman is a powerful tool for sending HTTP requests to test APIs without writing any code.  
In this project, Postman is used to verify that the Spring Boot backend endpoints work as expected.

- Download and install [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).
- Open the application and create a **new request**.

### Sending a `GET` Request
